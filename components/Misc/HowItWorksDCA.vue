      Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy that involves buying
      a specific asset at regular intervals over time, with the aim of reducing
      the average cost of the investment and minimizing the risk of market
      volatility.

    <p class="text-body-1 font-weight-bold" style="text-align: justify">
      When investing a lump sum into an asset, there is a risk of buying at a
      high point in the market and subsequently suffering losses if the price
      drops. However, with a DCA bot, users can enter a position based on their
      chosen indicator.

    <p class="text-body-1 font-weight-bold" style="text-align: justify">
      The bot will then take profit if the price hits the target level and begin
      averaging down if the price drops by the percentage set by the user. Take
      Profit level = Average Position + (Average position *Take profit
      percentage)
